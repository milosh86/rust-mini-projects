Potential mini projects:

- Cryptographic Hashing Tool: Create a CLI tool that takes an input string and
  outputs its cryptographic hash using popular algorithms like SHA-256 or
  Blake2.

- Simple Blockchain Implementation: Build a basic blockchain from scratch.
  Implement the core concepts like blocks, chains, proof of work, and basic
  validation. You can start with simple data structures and expand gradually.

- Basic Smart Contract: Use the ink! or Solang libraries to write a simple smart
  contract for a blockchain like Substrate or Ethereum. For example, you can
  create a basic contract for a token or a voting system.

- Transaction Validator: Develop a tool that validates blockchain transactions.
  It should check the validity of transactions based on predefined rules and
  verify signatures.

- Distributed Ledger: Implement a basic distributed ledger system where multiple
  nodes can add transactions and reach consensus using a simple algorithm like
  Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

- Merkle Tree
